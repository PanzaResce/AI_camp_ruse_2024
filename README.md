# AI Camp Ruse 2024 - Tackling Climate Change with Robot learning
## ABSTRACT
<i>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics into climate action represents a transformative approach to addressing the global challenge of
climate change. This paper explores the innovative
applications of AI and robotics across various sectors
such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, waste
management, and transportation. By enhancing the
precision and efficiency of data collection and analysis, these technologies offer potential solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, optimize resource use,
and improve sustainability efforts. This report discusses the challenges and barriers to integrating these
technologies, including technological limitations, high
costs, and the need for robust governance frameworks.
It also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary
collaboration and public engagement to ensure that
the integration of AI and robotics aligns with ecological and social goals. The future directions of this
burgeoning field emphasize scaling and affordability
of technological solutions, advancing regulatory frameworks, and fostering international cooperation to fully
harness the capabilities of AI and robotics in mitigating climate change impacts. This paper represents a
comprehensive overview of the current landscape and
the future of AI and robotics in environmental sustainability efforts.</i>
